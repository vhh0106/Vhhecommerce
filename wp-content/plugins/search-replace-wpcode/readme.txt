= Use Cases =

* **Site Migrations** - Quickly update URLs or any site data when moving your site.
* **Content Updates** - Easily replace outdated information or bulk update content across posts, pages, and custom post types.
* **Image Management** - Replace outdated images and avoid duplicate uploads.
* **Media Updates** - Replace media files in any format across your site.

= Tips for Using Search & Replace =

**Backup Your Database** - While the plugin is safe to use, it's always a good idea to make a backup before making changes.

Common mistakes to avoid when replacing text:

* Partial Matches - Ensure that you're not replacing partial matches that could affect unintended content. For example, replacing "cat" could affect "category" or "concatenate".
* Case Sensitivity - Be mindful of case sensitivity when replacing text. If you're looking to replace "Cat" with "Dog", ensure that you're not affecting "cat" or "CAT".
* URL Replacements - Always use the same format for both the search and replace values. For example if your search term has a trailing slash, ensure that the replacement term also has a trailing slash. E.g., "example.com/" to "example.net/" instead of "example.com/" to "example.net".
